#include <iostream> //used for input/output to communicate with the user via keyboard/monitor

int main(){  //Every C++ program must have 1 and only 1 "int main"; 

	// This is where the code goes: for example:

	std::cout << "Hello, world!\n"; 

	//std:cout is how the program communicates to the screen with text
	//The << operator (note the direction) takes the variables or text on the right and pushed them to the output (cout)
	//Sentences and words can be printed inside of double quotes ""
	// \n is a special character sequence that creates a new line

	return 0; //return 0 in C++ main means everything completed normally
