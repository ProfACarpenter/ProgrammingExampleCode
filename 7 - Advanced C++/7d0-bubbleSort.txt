We will assume for this bubble sort algorithm, we are trying to get the data sorted from lowest to highest value.

- Loop (until data are are not in order)
	- Loop (start at first element, move one place per iteration (i), stop when at the last element)
		- If the element at i is greater than i+1
			- Swap
		- Else, continue to the next iteration
		- If no swapping has occurred, the data are in order
