Below is an algorithmic description (in pseudocode) for finding the highest number in a list
- Create a space (we will call it "highestNumber") and save the first element on the list
- Starting at the 2nd element
	- Compare the highestNumber to the current element
	- If the current element is higher than the highestNumber
		- replace highestNumber with the current element's value
	- If not
		- Do nothing
	- Move to the next element until there are no elements left
- When all elements have been checked, you have the highest number
-----------------------------
Example:  List of 8 elements: 10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0  
First highestNumber (* symbol) is 10
Start at the second number for temporary comparison (! symbol)
Then compare 10 and 4.  Since 4 is lower, just move to the next element
	 * !
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
Repeat
 	 *   !
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
 	 *      !
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
When comparing 15, it is higher, so that is the newest "highestElement"
 	          *
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
 	 		   * !
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
When comparing 20, it is higher, so that is the newest "highestElement"
 	          	    *
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
 	          		* !
	10 4 2 -1 15 6 20 0 
Now that we reached the end, we know 20 is the highest.
